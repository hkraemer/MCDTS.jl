## LOG-file for the different experiments carried out for the combustion time series

Results in `./results` are based on the non-stationary time series in
`./data/Nonstationary/`, data 2 (Rate = 5; no blowout) from 21.10.2020,
downsampled by 50%. The random sampling was carried out over the entire time
series indices.

Results in `./results 2` are based on the stationary time series in
`./data/Stationary/p5.txt`. The random sampling was carried out over the entire
time series indices.

Results in `./results 3` are based on the non-stationary time series in
`./data/Nonstationary/Last interval`, data 2 (Rate = 5; no blowout) from 21.10.2020,
downsampled by 50%. The random sampling was carried out over the latter part of the
time series. Specifically, we used the results from `./results` to find out
parts of the time series, where the causal influence of heat release to pressure
was stronger than vice versa. This has been done in `investigate_indices.m` and
so the random sampling to place in the interval t_i = 1023952, t_f = 1255263
(indices based on the downsampled time series).

Results in `./results 4` are based on the non-stationary time series in
`./data/Nonstationary 2/`, from 09.08.2021. The random sampling was carried out over the entire
time series indices.
